# CS250

# Final Project Sprint Review and Retrospective:

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  To interpret user needs and implement them innto a program a scrum agile team would use User Stories.  This is a description of functions the end user would like to see implemented into the program, by the development team.  Creating user stories is helpful to the scrum team as a way of efficient communicaiton between the developers and end users.  Next, to approach developing programs, now and in the future, I plan to use a scrum agile approach.  This approach leads through the process of developing software with ease.  It also provides useful tools for collaboration and team work during said development process.  Finally, the meaning of being a good team member in software development, in my opinion, would be someone who is willing and ready to work with others.  As the scrum agile approach relies heavily on team work, everyone must be willing to collaborate and stay involved in order to maintain efficiency.
